\title{Peak search by first derivatives}

\description{
This function find all peaks by taking the first derivative based on 'rle' function. Is used in different Fragma functions.
}
\usage{
big.peaks.col(x,tre)
}

\arguments{
 \item{x}{A vector of heights or intensities}

\item{tre}{A scalar value deciding when peaks will be ignored}
}
\details{
No major details.
}
\value{
Retuns the biggest peaks for a vector of intensities.
\describe{
\item{out}{ a vector of positions where the derivative is zero and therefore a peak was found}
}
